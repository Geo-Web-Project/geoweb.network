Your use of the Services is subject to this Policy as well as our <a href="https://geoweb.network/terms">Terms of Service</a>.<br><br>‍<strong>Summary<br></strong>- Geo Web Network, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company that operates <a href="http://geoweb.network/">http://geoweb.network/</a>, <a href="https://geoweb.land/">https://geoweb.land/</a>, and <a href="https://geoweb.app/">https://geoweb.app/</a> among other products and services. The Company complies with United States of America laws and regulations.<br>- The Geo Web is an open information network used to publish and browse digital media associated with physical locations (the “Network”). The Services provide supporting functionality and convenience for interacting with the Network but are not the exclusive methods for doing so.<br>- The Company is not interested in trying to track you. It does not collect and store personal data, such as first name, last name, street address, date of birth, email address, or IP address, in connection with your use of the Services.<br>- The Services and supporting third-party tools (e.g. your wallet provider) rely on the use of public on-chain data and limited off-chain data to function.<br>- The Services use a performance monitoring tool offered by Google that collects and tracks aggregated usage data by browser type and corresponding page load times. We do this to help identify if something is broken.<br>- If you specifically sign up to receive emails from us, we will store your email address to allow us to send you those emails. You can unsubscribe at any time. We will not attempt to link your email address to your wallet address, IP address, or other personal data.<br>- Users are empowered to explore client-side privacy techniques and tools.<br>- Any material changes to privacy will be reflected in an updated privacy policy.<br><br>‍<strong>Data We Collect<br>‍</strong>The Company does not attempt to track the individual users of its Services.
