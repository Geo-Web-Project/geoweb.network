In general, the underlying software for blockchain networks tends to be open source such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using our Application, you acknowledge and agree (i) that the Company is not responsible for operation of the underlying software and networks that there exists no guarantee of functionality, security, or availability of such software and networks; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known as “ Forks ”), and that such Forks may materially affect the Services. It might be discretionarily decided not to support (or cease supporting) the Forked network entirely. You acknowledge and agree that the Company assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of any underlying software protocols, whether Forked or not.<br><br>Underlying networks use public/private key cryptography. You alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). The Company does not have access to your private key(s). Losing control of your private key will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain or other network. Neither the Company nor any other person will be able to retrieve or protect your funds. Once your private key(s) is lost, you will not be able to transfer your digital assets to any other address or wallet. If this occurs, you will not be able to realize any value or utility that you may hold now or in future. Further, we do not offer any custodial wallet services. <br><br>‍<strong>Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions<br>‍</strong>The services could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of the Company to continue to develop, or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the services.<br><br>‍<strong>Risk of Weaknesses or Exploits in the Field of Cryptography<br>‍</strong>You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies, digital assets and services, which could result in the theft or loss of your digital assets or property. To the extent possible, it is intended to update the protocol underlying the services to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but does not guarantee or otherwise represent full security of the system. By using the services or accessing the site, you acknowledge these inherent risks.<br>‍<br>‍<strong>Volatility of Digital Assets<br>‍</strong>You understand that blockchain technologies and associated digital assets, currencies or tokens are highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the blockchain. You acknowledge these risks and represent that the Company cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased costs.<br><br>‍<strong>Application Security<br>‍</strong>You acknowledge that the services offered through the Application are subject to flaws and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by us through the Application or independently located on the Network and/or Protocols. This warning and others provided in these Terms of Service by the Company in no way evidences or represents an ongoing duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing the services or accessing the Application.<br>‍<br>‍<strong>Accuracy<br>‍</strong>Although it is intended to provide accurate and timely information on the Application, the Application or relevant code may not always be entirely accurate, complete or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. In an effort to continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Application or relevant tools are your sole responsibility and the Company shall have no liability for such decisions. Links to third-party materials (including, without limitation, websites) may be provided as a convenience but are not controlled by the Company. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any aspect of the information, content, or services contained in any third-party materials or on any third party sites accessible or linked to the Application or available via other relevant tools.<br><br>No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the Application. <br><br>‍<strong>Risks<br>‍</strong>Use of the Application, in particular for interacting with or transferring digital assets, may carry risk. Digital assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, volatile and transactions transmitted to the Network are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Application at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading or transferring digital assets can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances. By using the Application, you represent that you have been, are and will be solely responsible for making your own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying digital assets. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted via the Application or any underlying digital assets. You accept all consequences of using the Application, including the risk that you may lose access to your digital assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you.
